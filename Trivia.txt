What is the difference between speed and velocity? 
1. There is no difference between speed and velocity 
2. Speed is how fast and in what direction an object is moving while velocity is the rate \ of which an object covers distance
3. Speed is a scalar quantity which describes the rate of which an object is moving while \ velocity is a vector quantity which describes the rate of which an object changes its position
